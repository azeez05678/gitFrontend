    <p>Vanilla Sponge cake is one of the most basic cake recipes. Made from staple ingredients found in our kitchen, this cake is extremely easy to make. There are just 5 major ingredients to this cake – flour, sugar, butter, eggs and baking powder.

        The British cuisine has a popular cake named Madeira Cake, which is nothing but a simple sponge cake. Unlike many other cakes, the sponge cake is set apart because it doesn’t require any fancy ingredient like leavening, shortening or products that are not easily available for home baking. The sponge cake is considered one of the earliest cakes that incorporated yeast-less baking technique which did not depend on yeast for the rise.</p>
